	<p>My name is Lisa and I raise AKC Registered black/silver Miniature Schnauzers.  I have both parents on-site.  My goal is to breed the best family, pet/companion Miniature Schnauzers that you can find. My dogs are from champion AKC lines with pedigrees going back 4+ generations. They have good, sound temperaments which are most important in breeding a healthy dog. My puppies are born inside my home under constant supervision during the entire whelping process. They are well socialized and have constant interaction with adults, children, and our pets.</p>

	<p>The Miniature Schnauzer is a small, squarely proportioned dog with a long head, bushy beard, mustache and eyebrows. They are an energetic, active dog, making for a delightful companion as an apartment dweller or someone with a small house and yard. They are charming and attractive; the perky Miniature Schnauzer is seldom addicted to wandering, being devoted to its home and family.</p>

	<p><strong>I am not a kennel</strong>, therefore, I will only have one litter of puppies per calendar year. I only breed my females once a year to give them rest in between whelping. My family and I love spending time with our dogs, they love to go camping and swim in our pool. They are very intelligent and easy to train.  They love being near their owner and they make excellent watch dogs. They have great temperaments, are good with children, and they make very loyal companions. Miniature Schnauzers are often described as non–shedding dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable, making them a wonderful pet for people that may be allergic to dander.</p>

	<p><strong>I do not sell my puppies to pet shops or brokers</strong>. I will not sell a puppy under the age of eight weeks. At this time they will be de-wormed, tails docked and dewclaws removed. Vaccinations will be given according to their age and my veterinarian will provide a veterinary health check up.</p>

<p>Your puppy will come with a sales contract and a detailed medical record for you and your veterinarian. You will also receive other helpful information regarding your new schnauzer puppy. All puppies will be sold with natural ears as I feel that cropping the ears is an individual decision. All companion (PET) puppies are sold with limited registration. Occasionally I will sell full registration to approved buyers for an additional fee and this would be discussed prior to the sale of the puppy.</p>

<p>If you decide on a Miniature Schnauzer, remember: they are extremely athletic, love to play, and can be very strong, so obedience training is important when they are young. They are extremely easy to train if their owner is firm and consistent and they have the ability to get very high scores in trial work when you choose to become involved because they have the intelligence and energy to work all day. If well cared for, they are a very long lived breed.</p>

<h2>Nutrition &amp; Vitamins</h2>
 <p>I feed my puppies Blue Buffalo (Life Protection Formula Chicken &amp; Brown Rice) and I recommend you keep your new puppy on Blue Buffalo for at least a couple of weeks after you receive him/her.</p>

 <p>I give NuVet plus to all of my dogs and puppies. Not only does it promote healthy coat and skin, it protects our pets from the daily toxins they are exposed to from the food, carpet and the backyard.  I honestly believe it is the best nutritional supplement on the market. I want them to have the best chance to live long and healthy lives.</p>

<p>This is not just a vitamin.  It is an immune system builder with a precise balance of vitamins, minerals, omega fatty acids, amino acids and high-potency antioxidants.  That’s why it works so well through all three stages of a dog’s life.</p>

<p>I noticed many breeders were using this product. When I did my research I found this product was able to help my older dogs as well as my pregnant females. The puppies that were born were benefiting from this product through the milk of their mother and later when they were weaned and were able to eat on their own.</p>

<p>Your puppy has been on NuVet Plus from day one. I highly recommend that you keep your new baby on NuVet Plus when you receive him/her.  This nutritional supplement is only available through breeder recommendation. You will receive detailed information in regards to this vitamin in your puppy pack. You may order directly from the manufacturer at <strong>800-474-7044</strong> and use my <em>personal order code: 11973</em> or <a href="http://www.nuvet.com/11973">visit NuVet online</a>.</p>
