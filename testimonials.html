	<p class="testimonial">"After the loss of my miniature schnauzer, Sir Lance-a-lot, I was not sure if I was ready for another puppy. Boy was I wrong! Although Mambo will never replace Sir Lance-a-lot, he has warmed my heart and brightened my home in a way I never expected. He is smart, quick to learn, eager to please, and is a great companion.</p>
